# Physics Simulation

## About:
Simulation of real world physics laws including collision detection and response. We used multiple balls to perform simulation. There are different types of shapes. Balls collide with themselves. They can collide with the wall or cylindar. In each case response are diffrerent.

## Platform: 
C++ using openGL.
